## Running each part of the project

### Leaderboard:

You need to run two python scripts to run the server

- `server/serveLeaderboard.py`
- `server/serveLeaderboardApi.py`

Once running you can access the leaderboard at [http://localhost:80/leaderboard.html](http://localhost:80/leaderboard.html)

### Client:

Just run `client/client.py` to run the client, you can change the server address either by directly editing `client/codeFolder/settings.py` or by passing the server address as a command line argument (see `client.py --help` for more info)
